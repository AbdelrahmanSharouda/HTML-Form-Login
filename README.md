# HTML-Form-Login
This login searches for the <form> part in the HTML code and then puts a certain username and password to log in inside the given url.
The url given is http://olympus.realpython.org/login 
Some values will be needed to change depending on the url.
I tried this code on rage-sage.com, values were increased by 1.
